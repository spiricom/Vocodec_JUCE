we definitely want those LEDs for the inputs and outputs
the amber ones glow with input and output level (fading in and out to reflect level)
and the red ones light up when the signal clip (if the input or output value goes above 0.99999 or below -0.99999)
not sure how to do the fading leds efficiently

>> Jeff related issues...
sampler button press acts strangely. seems like an issue with catching when you press and let go of the button - I think what this is that the D and E buttons are not working to switch the scale.
This ties into the edit button...
